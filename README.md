# Quasi-Newton-with-BFGS-line-search-algorithm
This is the Quasi-Newton algorithm for numerical optimization. The line-search algorithm to find the step-size is implemented with the 
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno(BFGS) line search method. Furthermore, the two functions of "Rosenbrock" and "Powel" as well as their gradient are provided to be passed to algorithm.
